00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.740
hello everyone and welcome to&nbsp;
the finance visualization project&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.520
to begin we noticed that in an accounting or&nbsp;
finance class students have trouble visualizing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.160
how balance sheets operate and therefore have&nbsp;
trouble figuring out how they actually work so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.040
we put together balance sheet information for&nbsp;
16 companies across a 12-year period to better&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:33.600
understand how different companies operate so in&nbsp;
our left view you're able to compare and contrast&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.080
different companies with filtering to choose which&nbsp;
ones to include and which ones not to include&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:47.280
here you're also able to utilize our tool&nbsp;
tips to dive deeper into specific accounts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.740
where each company has asset, liability,&nbsp;
and equity breakdowns per year&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.460
by clicking on a firm you're able to dive&nbsp;
deeper into it seeing trends over time for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.840
specific accounts as well as being able&nbsp;
to filter into these specific accounts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:11.880
then let's say you wanted to figure out a specific&nbsp;
value at a given year, you're able to filter by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.760
year and take a look at the percentage of&nbsp;
total assets that that specific account is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.040
let's say a user wanted to see the differences&nbsp;
between Apple and IBM at a specific time for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:35.220
example 2013. they're able to see specific values&nbsp;
for these accounts as well as trends over time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.720
it's important to note that the left&nbsp;
view shows everything as a proportion&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.780
so as you can see here assets make&nbsp;
up a hundred percent of itself while&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.660
liabilities and Equity add up to that&nbsp;
hundred percent so if you click through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:58.980
you're able to see trends over time as well&nbsp;
as specific data at a given point in time
